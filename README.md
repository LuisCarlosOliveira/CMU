## Project Scope

This project emerged from a group decision (Group 13) in the "Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing" course and focuses on designing an Android application capable of managing a Smart Home. Given the rapid advancement of technology, Smart Homes are becoming increasingly sought after, not just in Portugal, but around the world. This interest extends beyond tech enthusiasts to those who aim to have smarter, more sustainable homes. Such homes facilitate the monitoring of various devices, promoting sustainability, security, inhabitants' well-being, consumption optimization, waste reduction, personalized device settings, and many other benefits.

## Project Purpose

The project conception encompasses mechanisms discussed in Android lectures, ranging from designing layouts for each application screen to data storage and hosting the application on a real-time communication server. The primary objectives of this application include:

- Designing screen layouts that maximize functionality while minimizing complexity.
- Utilizing Intents for real-time communication with services or other Android internal applications, streamlining Smart Home management.
- Capturing, analyzing, and processing data generated by device sensors.
- Storing the gathered information and ensuring real-time access.

## Tools Used

For this project, the group decided to utilize ESTG's Gitlab for version control, storing the produced code, and facilitating the organized access to our application in real-time. The Android Studio, recommended by the professor, was used for code implementation, with Kotlin as the chosen programming language. Jetpack Compose was also incorporated into the development. Additionally, the professor provided APIs that supplied valuable information aiding in project development.
